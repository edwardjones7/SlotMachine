Inspiration

What it does
It allows you to gamble

How we built it
We used CAD software and arduino

Dimensioning as it doesn't fit, as well as time constraints. We also ran into problems with the camera, as we were unable to get the camera to recognize the objects of the slots.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We made the LCD work with buttons and changing brightness, as well as being able to build a tangible slot machine.

What we learned
It can be built or programmed with different types of things.
